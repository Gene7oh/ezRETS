          <i>At the California Association of REALTORS (C.A.R.), we
          collect housing data from various sources for the purpose of
          publishing aggregate statistics on Californiaâ€™s housing
          market. Several months ago, we collaborated with the Victor
          Valley Association of REALTORS, whose President is Charles
          Knapp, to automate our process of collecting data from that
          Association. For the past several months, we have
          successfully used ezRETS to query Victor Valley's RETS
          server. Since then, we have begun using ezRETS for two
          additional Associations in California.</i>
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>ezRETS has been running so smoothly for us that we are going
          to be rolling it out to many more Associations. The benefits
          of using ezRETS have included less manual work and more
          timely and complete statistical reports, both for C.A.R. and
          the local AORs.</i>

          <i>The really neat thing for me is that I've been using
          Filemaker Pro for over 15 years, and in my business have
          built many layouts and screens on other Filemaker databases
          that I use regularly.  My contracts, contacts, flyers, and
          even some MLS layout and search screens are all built.  I
          can now transfer this work over to the new tables and with
          the new Filemaker Scripting have a fairly sophisticated
          database in short order.  Filemaker allows me to
          automatically open the database upon system launch, go out
          to the MLS, grab all updates and pull them into my database
          automatically without any help on my part (all I need to do
          is get coffee while all this is occurring).  I will then
          have on my laptop, everything I need in regards to MLS data
          for the day.  And since I don't always have a network
          connection, this is a very nice convenience.  There is much
          more that can be done, but I'm really pleased with this as a
          start.</i>
