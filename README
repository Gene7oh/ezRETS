-- SQL Support --

ezRETS supports a subset of SQL for its RETS usage. We support things
in the form of

  SELECT some, columns FROM data:Resource:Class WHERE someColumn = someValue

  SELECT * FROM data:Resource:Class
           WHERE someColumn > someValue AND anotherColumn <= anotherValue

In the above examples, Resource and Class should be substituted with
the RETS Resources and Classes that your RETS server uses.

There are a few restrictions that ezRETS has that a regular database
doesn't have.

   1. Nothing but SELECT is supported. For now, and the forseeable future,
      ezRETS is a read-only view.
   2. You must have a WHERE clause to get data, there is no way to do a RETS
      query without a WHERE.  If you do not supply a WHERE clause, we simulate
      an empty result set with the proper columns.
   3. You cannot do JOINs of any sort, i.e. only one table per SELECT clause.
   4. ORDER BY is silently ignored as RETS has no equivalent functionality 

The following query is known to work on the demo RETS server at
http://demo.crt.realtors.org:6103/rets/login

   SELECT ListingID,ListDate FROM data:Property:ResidentialProperty
          WHERE ListPrice > 0

-- Misc notes --

    * If a MLS needs to know your User-Agent: ezRETS currently shows
      up with the User-Agent of "ezRETS/0.9.5 (librets/1.0.0b1)" The
      User-Agent is now configurable via the Data Source control panel
      or by editing your odbc.ini.  We do not encourage the practice
      of changing your User-Agent.

    * Currently, we do not implement RETS GetObject support. This
      means you cannot yet get images via ezRETS. This is planned for
      a future release.

-- Reporting Bugs --

To report bugs, we need a few pieces of information: which MLS or RETS
server you were trying to access, the ezrets debug log, and a SQL.LOG.
You can turn on the ezrets debug log on the Logging tab in the Data
Source control panel

On Windows, to create the SQL.LOG,go into the "Data Sources (ODBC)"
control panel, click on the tracing tab, and click on Start Tracing
Now.  Now, perform the actions that caused bad behavior.  When you
finish that, go back to the control panel and turn off tracing.

If the developers need more information they may also ask you to send
an HTTP log.  This log can also be configured via the Data Sources
control panel.

To get that information to the developers, there are two ways you can
do it:

1) Send e-mail to ezrets-users@crt.realtors.org with what you were
   doing, and the two files listen above.

   If you don't feel comfortable sending the logs to the open list,
   you can send them to ezrets-logs@crt.realtors.org which will only
   go to CRT's ezRETS developers.  These will not be shared in their
   entirety, however, small segments that do not violate any privcy
   may be used in bug descriptions and/or discussion on ezrets-users.

2) Or you can create a "trouble ticket" by visiting
   http://code.crt.realtors.org/projects/ezrets/newticket If possible,
   please search http://code.crt.realtors.org/projects/ezrets/report to
   make sure your bug hasn't been reported already.
