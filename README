-- Notes --

    * The User-Agent is configurable via the Data Source control
      panel or by editing your odbc.ini.  We do not encourage the
      practice of changing your User-Agent.  To see what ezRETS's
      default User-Agent is, please check the NEWS file.

-- Reporting Bugs --

To report bugs, we need a few pieces of information: which MLS or RETS
server you were trying to access, the ezrets debug log, the ezrets
http log, and a SQL.LOG.  You can turn on the ezrets logs on the
Logging tab in the Data Source control panel

On Windows, to create the SQL.LOG,go into the "Data Sources (ODBC)"
control panel, click on the tracing tab, and click on Start Tracing
Now.  Now, perform the actions that caused bad behavior.  When you
finish that, go back to the control panel and turn off tracing.

If the developers need more information they may also ask you to send
an HTTP log.  This log can also be configured via the Data Sources
control panel.

To get that information to the developers, there are two ways you can
do it:

1) Send e-mail to ezrets-users@crt.realtors.org with what you were
   doing, and the two files listed above.

   If you don't feel comfortable sending the logs to the open list,
   you can send them to ezrets-logs@crt.realtors.org which will only
   go to CRT's ezRETS developers.  These will not be shared in their
   entirety, however, small segments that do not violate any privacy
   may be used in bug descriptions and/or discussion on ezrets-users.

2) Or you can create a "trouble ticket" by visiting
   http://code.crt.realtors.org/projects/ezrets/newticket If possible,
   please search http://code.crt.realtors.org/projects/ezrets/report to
   make sure your bug hasn't been reported already.
