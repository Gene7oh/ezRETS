    <h1>SQL Support in ezRETS</h1>

    <p>
      ezRETS is read-only, only SELECT statements are supported.  The
      following is a quick reference on the grammar supported
    </p>
      
    <h2>Synopsis</h2>
    <p>
      <code>
        SELECT<br/>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* | count(*) | <i>column</i> [, ...]<br/>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FROM <i>table_name</i> [ [AS] <i>alias</i> ]<br/>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHERE <i>condition</i> [AND|OR ...]<br/>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[ LIMIT <i>count</i> ]<br/>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[ OFFSET <i>start</i> ]<br/>
      </code>
    </p>

    <h2>Description</h2>

    <h3>column names</h3>
    <p>
      The <i>column</i> name is taken from the RETS Table names or are
      defined below for <i>object:*</i> tables.
    </p>

    <h3>WHERE clause</h3>
    <p>
      We support the following operators in where conditions:
      <code>=</code>, <code>&lt;</code>, <code>&lt;=</code>,
      <code>&gt;</code>, <code>&gt;=</code>, <code>!=</code>,
      <code>&lt;&gt;</code>, <code>IN</code>, <code>NOT IN</code>.
      Conditions can also be grouped by parenthesis.
    </p>
    <p>
      Currently, prepared statements are not supported, so you cannot
      use <i>?</i> as a value in raw SQL and have it substituted
      later.  This will be addressed in future releases.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also, the values used in for RETS Lookups is the Lookup Type
      Value, not the Lookup Type LongValue or Lookup Type ShortValue.
      Support for being able to use either is being considered for
      future versions.
    </p>

    <h3>table names</h3>
    <p>
      <b>Data Tables:</b>  Table names are constructed from the RETS
      metadata by combining with colons the word <i>data</i>, the
      Resource name, and Class name.  For example, for the RETS
      Resource of <i>Property</i> and the Class of
      <i>ResidentialProperty</i>, the table name is
      <i>data:Property:ResidentialProperty</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>GetObject tables:</b> Object tables are named like this
      <i>object:location:&lt;Resource&gt;</i> or
      <i>object:binary:&lt;Resource&gt;</i>.  The big difference is
      that <i>object:location:*</i> tables will attempt to use the
      <code>Location=1</code> directive of RETS GetObject, and return
      a URL to the object requested.  If that cannot be accomplished,
      it returns the data as a blob.  <i>object:binary:*</i> tables
      will always get the data as a blob.
    </p>

    <h3>GetObject support</h3>
    <p>
      There are a fixed number of fields returned for each table, and
      you cannot select only certain fields (for now.)  This means
      that you can only effectively do a <code>SELECT *</code>&nbsp;&nbsp;
      <code>count(*)</code> is also not supported for GetObject tables.
    </p>
    <p>
      For <code>object:</code> searches, a WHERE has two required
      conditions and one optional condition.  You must have
      <ul>
        <li><code>type='<i>&lt;some type&gt;</i>'</code></li>
        and
        <li><code>object_key='<i>&lt;key value&gt;</i>'</code></li>
      </ul>
      as your required arguments.
      The possible values for type, as taken from the RETS spec, are:
      <ul>
        <li><code>Photo</code></li>
        <li><code>Plat</code></li>
        <li><code>Video</code></li>
        <li><code>Audio</code></li>
        <li><code>Thumbnail</code></li>
        <li><code>Map</code></li>
        <li><code>VRImage</code></li>
      </ul>
      The <code>object_key</code> is typically the primary key for the
      RETS Resource type.  The optional argument of
      <code>object_id</code> is to request a specific single item.
      For example, if there were 7 photos for a property and you just
      wanted the second one, you'd pass <code>object_id=2</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fields returned for each table type are as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      Table name: <code>object:binary:*</code>
      <table border="1">
        <tr><th>Column Name</th><th>Type</th></tr>
        <tr><td>object_key</td><td>VARCHAR</td></tr>
        <tr><td>object_id</td><td>INT</td></tr>
        <tr><td>mime_type</td><td>VARCHAR</td></tr>
        <tr><td>description</td><td>VARCHAR</td></tr>
        <tr><td>raw_data</td><td>LONGVARBINARY</td></tr>
      </table>
    </p>
    <p>
      Table name: <code>object:location:*</code>
      <table border="1">
        <tr><th>Column Name</th><th>Type</th></tr>
        <tr><td>object_key</td><td>VARCHAR</td></tr>
        <tr><td>object_id</td><td>INT</td></tr>
        <tr><td>mime_type</td><td>VARCHAR</td></tr>
        <tr><td>description</td><td>VARCHAR</td></tr>
        <tr><td>location</td><td>VARCHAR</td></tr>
        <tr><td>raw_data</td><td>LONGVARBINARY</td></tr>
      </table>
    </p>

    <h2>Limitations</h2>
    <p>
      Because a RETS server is not a traditional relational database,
      there are some limitations that are inherent in the translation
      process.
    </p>

    <h3>WHERE clause required</h3>
    <p>
      RETS does not have the concept of a query without some
      conditional attributes.  If you want meaningful data to be
      returned, you must have a WHERE clause in your SQL.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some applications will attempt to do a search without a WHERE in
      some situations.  To satisfy those applications an empty result
      set of the proper column width is returned by ezRETS.
    </p>

    <h3>No JOINs</h3>
    <p>
      As displayed in the synopsis above, there are no JOINs supported
      by ezRETS.  RETS does not have the concept of a join, therefor,
      ezRETS does not attempt to support one.
    </p>

    <h3>No ORDER BY</h3>
    <p>
      RETS does not have the concept of an ORDER BY, therefor, ezRETS
      does not attempt to support it.  If you supply an ORDER BY, it
      is silently ignored.
    </p>

    <h3><code>IS NULL</code> or <code>IS NOT NULL</code> not supported</h3>
    <p>
      RETS does not have the concept of querying on <code>IS
      NULL</code> or <code>IS NOT NULL</code>, so the driver does not
      support queries using those elements.
    </p>

    <h3>
      Not all servers support <code>LIMIT</code>, <code>OFFSET</code>,
      and GetObject
    </h3>
    <p>
      Not all RETS servers support these functions, however, there is
      not a good way for the driver to test if they are supported or
      not.  If a query does not do what you think it should do and
      you're using LIMIT, OFFSET, or a trying to get data from an
      <i>object:*</i> table, check with the ezRETS-users mailing list
      or your MLS to see if the equivalent RETS functionality is
      supported.
    </p>

    <h3>GetObject tables do not show up in ODBC metadata</h3>
    <p>
      GetObject tables and columns do not show yet up in ODBC metadata
      queries.  You will need to know the table names and what columns
      are returned to use those tables.  Wizards and the like will not
      display these as options as a result.  This is planned to be
      fixed in a future release.
