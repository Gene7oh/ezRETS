Installing the Prerequisites
============================

Install Apple's Developers Tools / XCode

wxWidgets
---------
  Version: 2.6.3 or higher
  URL: http://www.wxwidgets.org/

  The binary release uses the following configure call:
  ./configure --enable-universal_binary --enable-static=yes --disable-shared --enable-monolithic

Boost
-----
  Version: 1.33.0 or higher.
  URL: http://www.boost.org/

Boost has it's own build system, bjam.  Read it's instructions for
installation.  You need to compile and install the filesystem and
program options libraries.

librets
--------
  Version 1.2.2 or higher
  URL: http://www.crt.realtors.org/projects/rets/librets

libRETS must be compiled with the SQL Compiler (aka SQL to DMQL
Translator) built in.

Building ezrets
===============

The only supported way to build on OS X is via Xcode.

There is a Makefile.osx in the top level of the source tree.  This
calls out to xcode to build ezRETS.  In the Xcode preferences, you
must configure the Source Trees section to include various paths.
Some of these are from libRETS dependences, so if you do not see them
in the list above, its assume you already have them:
  ANTLR, CURL, BOOST, LIBRETS, EXPAT, WXWIDGETS

The project file is at EZRETS/project/build/ezrets.xcodeproj
