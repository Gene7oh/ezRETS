You can create a connection to an undefined data source by passing a
connection string to the SQLDriverConnect function in C.  Most ODBC
interfaces for other languages have similar functionality.  Look at
your ODBC interface's documentation.

For ezRETS a typical connection string will look something like:

LoginUrl=http://demo.crt.realtors.org:6103/rets/login;UID=Joe;PWD=Schmoe;StandardNames=true;UserAgent=optional/1.0;UseHttpGet=false;UseHttpLogging=true;HttpLogFile=/tmp/ezrets.http;UseDebugLogging=true;DebugLogFile=/tmp/ezrets;RetsVersion=1.5;UseBulkMetadata=false;IgnoreMetadataType=false;EnableUserAgentAuth=true;UserAgentAuthType=NON-STANDARD INTEREALTY;UserAgentPassword=SomePasswd

It should be not noted that in a connection string the following
fields are optional:
 * UserAgent
 * UseHttpGet
 * UseHttpLogging
 * HttpLogFile
 * UseDebugLogging
 * DebugLogFile
 * RetsVersion
 * UseBulkMetadata
 * IgnoreMetadataType
 * EnableUserAgentAuth
 * UserAgentAuthType
 * UserAgentPassword
 * UseCompactFormat
 * TreatDecimcalAsString

Definitions of attributes:
 * LoginURL - RETS Server's LoginURL
 * UID - username
 * PWD - password
 * StandardNames - use RETS Standard Names when talking to the server
 * UserAgent - Used if you need to override the default user agent passed
               to the RETS server.
 * UseHttpGet - Use HTTP GET instead of HTTP POST when doing a search
 * UseHttpLogging - Use the HTTP logging facility
 * HttpLogFile - The file to log the HTTP transactions to
 * UseDebugLogging - Use ezRETS debug logging facility
 * DebugLogFile - The file to log the ezRETS debugging to
 * RetsVersion - Which RETS version to attempt to speak to the server
                 1.0 and 1.5 are the only accepted values
 * UseBulkMetadata - Grab all the metadata at once instead of incrementally
 * IgnoreMetadataType - Don't trust the server's metadata on what it reports
                        as the native data type, just return everything as
                        Character data.
 * EnableUserAgentAuth - Turns on User-Agent Authentication
 * UserAgentAuthType - Currently only "NON-STANDARD INTEREALTY" is supported.
 * UseCompactFormat - If true, ezRETS will use COMPACT format instead of
                      COMPACT-DECODED
 * TreatDecimalAsString - Causes DECIMAL fields to be treated as CHAR fields.
                          This is a temporary work around for failures with
                          VBScript and SQLServer DTS.
