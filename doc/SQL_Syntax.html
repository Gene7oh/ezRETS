    <h1>SQL Support in ezRETS</h1>

    <p>
      ezRETS is read-only, only SELECT statements are supported.  The
      following is a quick reference on the grammar supported
    </p>
      
    <h2>Synopsis</h2>
    <p>
      <code>
        SELECT<br/>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* | <i>column</i> [, ...]<br/>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FROM <i>table_name</i> [ [AS] <i>alias</i> ]<br/>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHERE <i>condition</i> [AND|OR ...]<br/>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[ LIMIT <i>count</i> ]<br/>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[ OFFSET <i>start</i> ]<br/>
      </code>
    </p>

    <h2>Description</h2>

    <h3><i>column</i> names</h3>
    <p>
      The <i>column</i> name is taken from the RETS Table names.
    </p>

    <h3>WHERE clause</h3>
    <p>
      We support the following operators in where conditions: =, &lt;,
      &lt;=, &gt;, &gt;=, !=, &lt;&gt;, IN, NOT IN.  Conditions can
      also be grouped by parenthesis.
    </p>
    <p>
      Currently, prepared statements are not supported, so you cannot
      use <i>?</i> as a value in raw SQL and have it substituted
      later.  This will be addressed in future releases.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also, the values used in for RETS Lookups is the Lookup Type
      Value, not the Lookup Type LongValue or Lookup Type ShortValue.
      Support for being able to use either is being considered for
      future versions.
    </p>

    <h3>table names</h3>
    <p>
      Table names are constructed from the RETS metadata by combining
      with colons the word <i>data</i>, the Resource name, and Class
      name.  For example, for the RETS Resource of <i>Property</i> and
      the Class of <i>ResidentialProperty</i>, the table name is
      <i>data:Property:ResidentialProperty</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The preface of <i>data</i> is required for future enhancments.
      When RETS GetObject is supported, it will use the prefix of
      <i>object</i>.
    </p>

    <h2>Limitations</h2>
    <p>
      Because a RETS server is not a traditional relational database,
      there are some limitations that are inherent in the translation
      process.
    </p>

    <h3>WHERE clause required</h3>
    <p>
      RETS does not have the concept of a query without some
      conditional attributes.  If you want meaningful data to be
      returned, you must have a WHERE clause in your SQL.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some applications will attempt to do a search without a WHERE in
      some situations.  To satisfy those applications an empty result
      set of the proper column width is returned by ezRETS.
    </p>

    <h3>No JOINs</h3>
    <p>
      As displayed in the synopsis above, there are no JOINs supported
      by ezRETS.  RETS does not have the concept of a join, therefor,
      ezRETS does not attempt to support one.
    </p>

    <h3>No ORDER BY</h3>
    <p>
      RETS does not have the concept of an ORDER BY, therefor, ezRETS
      does not attempt to support it.  If you supply an ORDER BY, it
      is silently ignored.
    </p>
