We don't current have an installer for the ODBC driver for linux.  To
make the driver work on Linux, after building it, copy it to a known
location.

To make the odbc infrastructure aware of the driver, you'll need to
add an entry for the driver to /etc/odbcinst.ini or ~/.odbcinst.ini.
If you're installing to work with PHP or some other app/language that
may not run as your user, you'll want to make sure its in
/etc/odbcinst.ini.

To create an instance of a datasource, you'll need to add an entry for
the datasource to /etc/odbc.ini or ~/.odbc.ini.  If you're installing
to work with PHP or some other app/language that may not run as your
user, you'll want to make sure its in /etc/odbc.ini.

Driver          = ezRETS ODBC Driver
LoginURL        = http://demo.crt.realtors.org:6103/rets/login
UID             = Joe

It should be not noted that in an odbc.ini declaration, the following
fields are optional:
 * UserAgent
 * UseHttpGet
 * UseHttpLogging
 * HttpLogFile
 * UseDebugLogging
 * DebugLogFile
 * RetsVersion
 * UseBulkMetadata
 * IgnoreMetadataType
 * UseCompactFormat


Definitions of attributes:
 * LoginURL - RETS Server's LoginURL
 * UID - username
 * PWD - password
 * StandardNames - use RETS Standard Names when talking to the server
 * UserAgent - Used if you need to override the default user agent passed
               to the RETS server.
 * UseHttpGet - Use HTTP GET instead of HTTP POST when doing a search
 * UseHttpLogging - Use the HTTP logging facility
 * HttpLogFile - The file to log the HTTP transactions to
 * UseDebugLogging - Use ezRETS debug logging facility
 * DebugLogFile - The file to log the ezRETS debugging to
 * RetsVersion - Which RETS version to attempt to speak to the server
                 1.0 and 1.5 are the only accepted values
 * UseBulkMetadata - Grab all the metadata at once instead of incrementally
 * IgnoreMetadataType - Don't trust the server's metadata on what it reports
                        as the native data type, just return everything as
                        Character data.
