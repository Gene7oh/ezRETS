We don't current have an installer for the ODBC driver for linux.  To
make the driver work on Linux, after building it, copy it to a known
location.

To make the odbc infrastructure aware of the driver, you'll need to
add an entry for the driver to /etc/odbcinst.ini or ~/.odbcinst.ini.
If you're installing to work with PHP or some other app/language that
may not run as your user, you'll want to make sure its in
/etc/odbcinst.ini.

To create an instance of a datasource, you'll need to add an entry for
the datasource to /etc/odbc.ini or ~/.odbc.ini.  If you're installing
to work with PHP or some other app/language that may not run as your
user, you'll want to make sure its in /etc/odbc.ini.
